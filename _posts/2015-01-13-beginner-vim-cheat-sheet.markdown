Over the past month or so, I have been making the gradual switch from [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29) after reading about its supposed increase in efficency. Although I had been warned of vim's steep learning curve, I actually found the transition to be rather smooth, and I'm now feeling about as comfortable with it as I did with ST2.

One of the things that really helped me internalize vim's plethora of commands and shortcuts was making my own cheatsheet. I would suggest you do the same, but if you want to cheat *(pun)* and save yourself some time, you can take a look at what I've made.

<div style="
  width:800px;
  height:620px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background:#ccc;
  padding:10px;
  position:relative;
  margin:auto ">

</div>

You can download it in PDF format [here](https://github.com/lancelafontaine/vim-cheatsheet/raw/master/vimcheatsheet.pdf), as well as view the LaTeX code used to make the document in this [Github repository](https://github.com/lancelafontaine/vim-cheatsheet).
