<p>Over the past month or so, I have been making the gradual switch from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29">vim</a> after reading about its supposed increase in efficency. Although I had been warned of vim’s steep learning curve, I actually found the transition to be rather smooth, and now feeling about as comfortable as I did with ST2.</p>

<p>One of the things that really helped me internalize the plethora of vim’s commands and shortcuts was making my own cheatsheet. I would suggest you do the same, but if you want to save yourself some time,</p>
