<p>My name is Lance Lafontaine and I am a software engineering student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a> in Montreal, Canada. I love full-stack web dev, Linux and Unix operating systems, and everything about open source and startups.</p>

<p>Why software, you ask? Believe it or not, my lifelong coding quest began with ...</p>

<h2>DNA and Proteins.</h2>

<p> Once upon a time, I was studying in <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/jubr4FR.jpg">molecular biology</a>. I had decided to pursue my studies in the field after my introduction to it in college. The content was rather interesting, and I was pretty good at memorizing biochemical reactions and cellular functions and structures.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2013. I was working in a synthetic biology lab for my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lancelafontaine/undergraduate-biology-thesis">undergraduate thesis</a> and an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Genetically_Engineered_Machine">iGEM team</a> and I quickly realized that <em>lab work was not for me</em>. Given my knowledge set at the time, I took a few bioinformatics and computational biology courses, as well as an introductory Java course, COMP248.</p>

<p> The computational biology course with <a target="_blank" href="http://web.chem.ucsb.edu/~molvisual/Img/143/kissingloop_bindsite_front_withbonds.png">PyMoL</a> was fun, but <strong>Java instantly blew me away</strong>. The logic kept me so engaged. Compiling was just so <em>gratifying</em>. COMP248 was more fulfilling to me than any other I had taken over the previous three years: I had gained the seemingly-magical power to tell my computer to do complex tasks, <em>and it obeyed me without question</em>.</p>

<p>But with great power comes great responsibility. The change in career paths was a difficult realization to come to terms with, especially after working so hard for an entire degree's worth, but I couldn't deny that <a target="_blank" href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">this developer's life</a> was for me.</p>

<p>After considering some options that were available to me (like an Independent Master's in Bioinformatics), I decided to look into another Bachelor's degree because it would provide me with a stronger foundation in computer science as well as the possibility for paid internships to help me finance my studies. I ended up applying for the Software Engineering Co-op program at Concordia and <a target="_blank" href="http://cdn1.hubspot.com/hub/245581/file-317911732.jpg">got in</a>.</p>

<p> And now here I am, enjoying my first semester in the new program. There are <em>so many</em> new concepts, languages, and technologies to learn, but I'm extremely happy with my current situation, and that is truly what matters most to me.</p>

<p>I will be updating this blog semi-regularly provided that coursework doesn't get in the way, so be sure to check back here for new blog posts, rants, milestones, stories and/or opinionated thoughts along the way to my developer path. I'd love to hear from you too: leave a comment below.</p>
