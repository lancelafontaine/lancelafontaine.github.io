        <title>Hello, world! A first post from a new developer.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Lance Lafontaine and I am a software engineering student at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.concordia.ca/&quot;&gt;Concordia University&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal, Canada. I love full-stack web dev, Linux and Unix operating systems, and everything about open source and startups.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Why software, you ask? Believe it or not, my lifelong coding quest began with ...&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;DNA and Proteins.&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt; Once upon a time, I was studying in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/jubr4FR.jpg&quot;&gt;molecular biology&lt;/a&gt;. I had decided to pursue my studies in the field after my introduction to it in college. The content was rather interesting, and I was pretty good at memorizing biochemical reactions and cellular functions and structures.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 2013. I was working in a synthetic biology lab for my &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/lancelafontaine/undergraduate-biology-thesis&quot;&gt;undergraduate thesis&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Genetically_Engineered_Machine&quot;&gt;iGEM team&lt;/a&gt; and I quickly realized that &lt;em&gt;lab work was not for me&lt;/em&gt;. Given my knowledge set at the time, I took a few bioinformatics and computational biology courses, as well as an introductory Java course, COMP248.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; The computational biology course with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://web.chem.ucsb.edu/~molvisual/Img/143/kissingloop_bindsite_front_withbonds.png&quot;&gt;PyMoL&lt;/a&gt; was fun, but &lt;strong&gt;Java instantly blew me away&lt;/strong&gt;. The logic kept me so engaged. Compiling was just so &lt;em&gt;gratifying&lt;/em&gt;. COMP248 was more fulfilling to me than any other I had taken over the previous three years: I had gained the seemingly-magical power to tell my computer to do complex tasks, &lt;em&gt;and it obeyed me without question&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But with great power comes great responsibility. The change in career paths was a difficult realization to come to terms with, especially after working so hard for an entire degree&#39;s worth, but I couldn&#39;t deny that &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://thisdeveloperslife.com/&quot;&gt;this developer&#39;s life&lt;/a&gt; was for me.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;After considering some options that were available to me (like an Independent Master&#39;s in Bioinformatics), I decided to look into another Bachelor&#39;s degree because it would provide me with a stronger foundation in computer science as well as the possibility for paid internships to help me finance my studies. I ended up applying for the Software Engineering Co-op program at Concordia and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://cdn1.hubspot.com/hub/245581/file-317911732.jpg&quot;&gt;got in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; And now here I am, enjoying my first semester in the new program. There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; new concepts, languages, and technologies to learn, but I&#39;m extremely happy with my current situation, and that is truly what matters most to me.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I will be updating this blog semi-regularly provided that coursework doesn&#39;t get in the way, so be sure to check back here for new blog posts, rants, milestones, stories and/or opinionated thoughts along the way to my developer path. I&#39;d love to hear from you too: leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
